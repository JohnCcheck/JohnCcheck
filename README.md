- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @JohnCcheck
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in understanding how a barcode scanner can connect to Clover
I work for a company that manufactures and sells our own brand of barcode scanners, and we are interested in seeing how we can test or configure our scanners so that they are compatible with Clover's POS systems.
Can anyone guide me through this, please?
